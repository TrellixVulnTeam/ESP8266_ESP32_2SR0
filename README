This is my sonoff Firmware and developing sdk
All these devices send data via MQTT and be
connected via telnet.
I have interfaced I2C CO2 sensors and many others.
All sonoff devices can be selected via Makefile
(some a very HW customized)
All firmwares can be updated via wifi (TCP connection, make wiflash)


set you .profile with
export PATH=/home/name/esp-open-sdk/xtensa-lx106-elf/bin:$PATH
